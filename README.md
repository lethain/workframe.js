Currently this is just a placeholder, still working on a few things,
but should be available by end of week.

## Ideas

* mininal coupling
* make it possible to develop and maintain relatively complex node.js apps without blowing your mind
* regex based url dispatching (ala Django's urlpatterns)
* define workflow segments which asynchronously do some unit of work
* workflows to which connect one segment with another while masking
    the developer from the inevitable nested callbacks
* utilities
    * I happen to be using Mu (which uses Mustache), so will have some utilities for rendering via Mu
    * I happen to be using Redis, so some utilities along this way as well
